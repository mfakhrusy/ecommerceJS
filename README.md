# ecommerceJS
An e-commerce web application made in React JS.
This is a mockup front end so all data is provided by static JSON.
Some of the features that need a backend and database (like user comment and user wishlist) are done on user state only. So if the page refresh, the state is refreshed.

Feature: 
1. Masonry Layout.
2. Fully Responsive.
3. Category filter, search filter, and price filter.
4. Map location of seller.
5. Favorite button (wishlist).
6. Ask seller feature.
7. Incremental loading image for performance.

Still not finished feature:
1. Add your own image to sell (yes this is the most important but still need things to be done).
2. Lazy loading offscreen image. (defer load until user scroll)
